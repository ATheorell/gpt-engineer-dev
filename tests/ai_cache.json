A function to handle the file writing operation.\\n\\nThe main script will be named `main.py`, and it will contain the entry point of the program. It will import and call a function from a separate module that handles the file writing.\\n\\nThe file writing functionality will be encapsulated in a function named `write_to_file`, which will be part of a module named `file_writer.py`. This function will take a filename and a message as arguments and write the message to the specified file.\\n\\nLet's start with the entry point file:\\n\\nmain.py\\n```\\nfrom file_writer import write_to_file\\n\\ndef main():\\n    write_to_file('output.txt', 'hello')\\n\\nif __name__ == '__main__':\\n    main()\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's create the `file_writer.py` module that contains the `write_to_file` function:\\n\\nfile_writer.py\\n```\\ndef write_to_file(filename, message):\\n    with open(filename, 'w') as file:\\n        file.write(message)\\n```\\n\\nSince this is a simple script with no external dependencies, we do not need a `requirements.txt` file. The Python standard library provides all the necessary functionality for file operations.\\n\\nThis concludes a fully working implementation.\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"example\": false}}]", "[{\"type\": \"system\", \"data\": {\"content\": \"You will get information about a codebase that is currently on disk in the current folder.\\nFrom this you will answer with code blocks that includes all the necessary unix terminal commands to:\\na) install dependencies\\nb) run all necessary parts of the codebase (in parallel if necessary)\\nDo not install globally.
